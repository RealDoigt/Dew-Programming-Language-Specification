# Dew Programming Language Specification
## Introduction
Dew is a high level programming language intended for experimenting with niche concepts. It is called Dew because it is Doigt's first serious language project and dew usually appear during the morning, which is the first part of the day.
Dew's syntax is highly inspired by Algol68 and Bash as well as more modern languages such as D, Java and some functional languages. As far as the author is aware, there is only one active project working on a Dew compiler and it is his own project, which is far from complete.
This language specification doesn't describe what current compiler(s) can do but what they should do.
