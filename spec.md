# Dew Programming Language Specification
## Introduction
Dew is a high level programming language intended for experimenting with niche concepts. It is called Dew because it is Doigt's first serious language project and dew usually appear during the morning, which is the first part of the day. Dew's syntax is highly inspired by Algol68, Bash and B as well as more modern languages such as D. As far as the author is aware, there is only one active project working on a Dew compiler and it is his own project, which is far from complete. This language specification doesn't describe what current compiler(s) can do but what they should do.

## Literals
Dew has 4 types of literals: boolean literals, string literals, character literals and numeric literals.

### Boolean
A boolean literal is defined as being one of two valid keywords; `true` or `false`.

### String
A string literal is defined as a sequence of characters enclosed between a pair of double quotes `"`.

### Character
A character literal is defined as a sequence of characters enclosed between a pair of single quotes `'`.

### Numeric
A numeric literal is defined as a sequence of case sensitive characters which represents binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F). Numbers can be separated by underscores `_` for added legibility. Each non-decimal sequence must start with a dollar sign `$` then a lower case letter representing that base: 
* Binary: $b1010_1011
* Octal: $o253
* Decimal: 171
* Hexadecimal: $xAB

### Escape Sequences
Escape sequences are special character sequences which begin with an asterisk `*`. They are used in character and string literals for characters that are not practical to type on a keyboard or characters which have a special functionality:
| name | sequence|
|-|-|
| tabulation |\*t|
| carriage return| \*r|
| new line |\*n|
| null character| \*0|
| single-quote |\*'|
| double-quote |\*"|
| asterisk |\*\*|
| backspace |\*b|
| vertical tabulation| \*v|
| bell |\*a|
| form feed| \*f|
